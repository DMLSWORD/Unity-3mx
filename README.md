# Unity3MXB

Load [3MX/3MXB](https://docs.bentley.com/LiveContent/web/ContextCapture%20Help-v9/en/GUID-CED0ABE6-2EE3-458D-9810-D87EC3C521BD.html) LOD model files generated by Bentley ContextCapture into Unity.
>NOTE: When using Bentley ContextCapture to generate 3MX format LOD model files, there is always a 3MXB root file generated under the Data folder. We use this 3MXB root file to import the model into Unity.

### Tested Env:
- Windows 10
- Unity2018.4.23f1

### Thirdparty (source codes included for convenience):
- [OpenCTM](https://github.com/BarryWangYang/OpenCTM-Optimizing-GC-)
- [NanoJpeg](https://github.com/Deathspike/NanoJPEG.NET)
- [Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity)

### Known issues
- Frame rate is NOT stable because mesh and texture could NOT be uploaded to GPU in thread(I do not know whether this is a Unity issue or just because I am not an expert of Unity).
- Cache strategy is NOT optimized.
